# PassVault

## What is This?
This was a project that I made my senior year of high school in order to test different aspects of
Android development. I was interested in making a practical tool to store all passwords and user
information that itself was password protected. 

## What Now?
I wish to continue adding more features and implement ideas that I had when I first started designing
this project. This includes making the app itself look sleeker as well as adding more functionality, such
as potentially linking it to the cloud.
